# 2d-Tile-GameDev-Ennvironment

## Description

Design and implement an extensible Tile-Matching Game Environment (TMGE). We will adhere to the definition of a tile-matching game as used in this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-matching_video_game).

## Team Structure
- Work in teams of 4-5 students
- In-class team formation assistance available
- Assignment to teams if needed

## Requirements

The TMGE should:
- Accommodate any tile-matching game involving a grid layout and game elements (e.g. Tetris, Klax, Bejeweled, etc.)
- Facilitate easy implementation of new games
- Provide a defined interface for all games
- Support two players on the same local machine
- Include personal player profiles (flexible specifications)
- Support 2-player games minimum (additional player support optional)
- Present players with a selectable game list

## Deliverables

1. The TMGE core system
2. Two or more tile-matching games built on the TMGE
3. Documentation
4. Running instructions
5. Runnable code via GitHub repository
6. Peer evaluations

## Development Guidelines

### Reuse Policy
- No existing game environment implementations
- Component reuse requires professor approval

### Grading Criteria

Stakeholder considerations:
1. **Players**: Quality of gaming experience
2. **Future TMGE Developers**: Code quality and design clarity
3. **Game Developers**: TMGE extensibility and API usability
4. **Team Members**: Individual contributions

*Note: GUI is optional but may simplify implementation*

### Technical Requirements
- Clear designation of variant vs fixed components
- Use of configuration management repository
- Flexible presentation responsibilities within team

## Development Schedule

### In-Class Sessions
Multiple weeks dedicated to:
- Team meetings
- Professor consultations
- TA discussions
- Design and implementation work

### Final Two Weeks

#### Final Demo
- TMGE and game demonstration
- 10-minute maximum per team

#### Documentation
Submit via Canvas:
- Final design document
- Updated UML with explanations
- New game implementation guide
- Design evolution description
- Project retrospective
- Peer evaluations

## Project Management Suggestions

1. Team Organization
   - Create sub-teams
   - Appoint team lead(s)
   - Focus on efficient division of work

2. Communication
   - Utilize group communication tools (e.g., Slack)

3. Development Approach
   - Identify common game elements
   - Build strong abstractions
   - Develop clear interfaces

## Extra Credit Opportunities

1. GUI Implementation (3% extra credit)
2. Real-time Play Support (3% extra credit)
